# Graduate-Admission-Prediction-using-ANN\
<p>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
This project aims to predict whether a student will be admitted to a graduate program based on various important parameters like GRE score, TOEFL score, University Rating, etc. Using historical admission data, we develop a predictive model to provide insights into the factors influencing graduate school admission.

  <h2>Objective</h2>
The primary objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of a student being admitted to a graduate program based on the following features:

GRE score
TOEFL score
University Rating
Statement of Purpose (SOP)
Letter of Recommendation (LOR)
CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average)
Research Experience
